## Instructions

`query_bot.py` is the script we used to generate the profiles.

`generate_speech.py` is the script we used to generate the voice samples. We used [OpenAI's Audio API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech).

You can also find the search questions (queries) and voice commands that we used for experiments in dedicated folders.
