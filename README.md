### Instructions

`query_bot.py` is the script we used to generate the profiles.

`generate_speech.py` is the script we used to generate the voice samples. We used [OpenAI's Audio API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech).

`queries.txt` includes the queries we used to generate the profiles as well as for testings.

You can also find the search questions (queries) and voice commands that we used for experiments in dedicated folders.
